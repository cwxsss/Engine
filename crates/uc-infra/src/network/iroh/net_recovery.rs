//! Relay self-healing watchdog.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! iroh only rebuilds its DNS resolver + rebinds sockets when the OS network
//! monitor delivers a *major* link-change event (`socket.rs::handle_network_change`
//! → `dns_resolver.reset()`). On Windows the netmon route/address callbacks
//! push into a bounded channel with `try_send`; during a boot-time route storm
//! that channel fills and the notification is dropped (`netwatch` logs
//! `unable to send: route change notification: Full(..)`). If the daemon
//! captured an incomplete system DNS config at that moment, the endpoint's
//! resolver stays wedged: every relay hostname fails to resolve
//! (`Resolve failed, IPv4/IPv6`) and — since this node reaches peers over the
//! relay — every peer shows offline. Observed in the field as "opens offline,
//! a manual restart fixes it": restart rebuilds the resolver against the now-
//! healthy network, but nothing in-process ever did.
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! Watches [`Endpoint::home_relay_status`]. When the home relay stays
//! continuously unhealthy past a short grace period, it **resets the
//! endpoint's DNS resolver directly** (`endpoint.dns_resolver().reset()`),
//! which re-reads the current system DNS config, then calls
//! [`Endpoint::network_change`] to prompt a relay redial. Retries escalate
//! with exponential backoff and stop the moment the relay reconnects.
//!
//! **Why the direct reset, not just `network_change()`:** the first draft
//! only called `network_change()`, on the assumption it runs the same
//! `dns_resolver.reset()` path a restart would. It does not, reliably:
//! `network_change()` only reaches that reset when netwatch observes an
//! actual interface delta — `netmon::actor::handle_potential_change`
//! early-returns on `old_state == new_state`. The dominant repro is a process
//! restart on an *unchanged* network (installer auto-relaunch), so the
//! interface state is identical, the "major change" path never fires, and the
//! reset never happens (confirmed in field logs: a nudge with no recovery).
//! Resetting the resolver ourselves is unconditional and is the actual fix.
//!
//! This targets the root cause, not a symptom: a manual app restart recovers
//! instantly (proving the *system* DNS is healthy — only this process's
//! resolver is wedged), and `reset()` reproduces that recovery in-process
//! without a restart. The reset is lazy (no IO until the next lookup) and
//! harmless even when the network is genuinely down.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Only spawned when relays are enabled. In LAN-only mode
//! (`disable_relays = true`) there is no home relay by design, so the "no
//! healthy relay" signal is expected and this watchdog is not started.
