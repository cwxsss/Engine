//! Presence port (Slice 2 Phase 1).
//!
//! Tracks whether each `SpaceMember` is currently reachable on the iroh
//! endpoint. Consumed by `MemberRosterFacade` for the roster view and by
//! `EnsureReachableAllUseCase` which fires after F1 `start_network` to
//! pre-connect every member.
//!
//! `ensure_reachable` is a single-target primitive; batching ("pre-connect
//! the whole roster") lives in the application layer so this port stays
//! minimal.
